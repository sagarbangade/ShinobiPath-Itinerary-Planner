A well-designed travel itinerary planning tool can streamline this process, allowing users to consolidate their plans in one place, collaborate with others, and create a more enjoyable travel experience.

**Project Goal:**  
Create an intuitive travel itinerary planning tool that empowers users to seamlessly organize their travel plans by adding destinations, dates, activities, and collaborating with others.
