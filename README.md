## Design Decisions or Assumptions

- **React Frontend:** The application is built using React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Material UI (MUI):**  Utilizes Material UI for consistent UI components and styling, providing a professional and accessible design.
- **Firebase Backend:** Leverages Firebase for authentication (Google Sign-in), Firestore database for storing user data and itineraries, and Firebase Storage for profile picture uploads. This choice simplifies backend development and deployment.
- **Google Maps Platform:**  Integrates Google Maps APIs for map display, location search (Places API), and distance calculations (Distance Matrix API), providing rich location-based functionality.
- **Google Gemini API for Chatbot:** Implements Google's Gemini AI model to provide intelligent and context-aware assistance to users for travel planning within the application.
- **Context API for State Management:** React's Context API is used for managing application-wide state, such as chatbot state and itinerary data, promoting efficient data sharing between components.
- **Drag and Drop Interface:** Implements drag and drop functionality using `react-beautiful-dnd` to allow users to easily reorder destinations and items within itineraries, enhancing user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and accessible across different devices (desktop and mobile), using media queries and responsive UI frameworks like Material UI and Tailwind CSS.

## Installation & Getting started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

    cd shinobipath-itinerary-planner
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**
    *   Create a Firebase project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Enable Google Sign-in in your Firebase project's Authentication settings.
    *   Create a Firestore database in your Firebase project.
    *   Obtain your Firebase project configuration (API key, authDomain, projectId, etc.) from the Firebase console (Project settings -> General -> Web apps).
    *   Replace the placeholder values in `src/firebase/firebaseConfig.js` with your Firebase project configuration.

4.  **Set up Google Maps API Key:**
    *   Obtain a Google Maps API key with the Places API, Maps JavaScript API, and Distance Matrix API enabled from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    *   Replace the placeholder API key value `"AIzaSyDHTUzAPE4mdiY6bKHtghFPEzmOJQUXI6I"` in `src/pages/Map.js` and other components using Google Maps APIs with your actual Google Maps API key.
    *   Ensure billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project as required by Google Maps Platform.

5.  **Set up Google Gemini API Key:**
    *   Obtain a Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/).
    *   Replace the placeholder API key value `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in `src/contexts/ChatbotContext.jsx` and `src/components/Chatbot.jsx` with your actual Gemini API key.

6.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

7.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the address shown in your terminal).

## Usage

## Credentials

For demonstration purposes, you can use Google Sign-in with any Google account to access the application. There are no specific pre-defined user credentials required.

## APIs Used

-   **Firebase:**
    -   [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth): For user authentication (Google Sign-in).
    -   [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore):  For NoSQL database to store user data, itineraries, and chat messages.
    -   [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage): For storing user profile pictures.
-   **Google Maps Platform:**
    -   [Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview): For location search and place details.
    -   [Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview): For embedding interactive maps in the application.
    -   [Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/overview): For calculating distances and travel times between destinations.
-   **Google Gemini API:**
    -   [Generative AI API](https://ai.google.dev/): For powering the Travel AI Assistant chatbot.

## API Endpoints

As this is primarily a frontend application with Firebase handling the backend, there are no traditional API endpoints in the sense of a RESTful backend server.

Data is directly accessed and manipulated in the frontend using Firebase SDK methods interacting with Firebase services (Firestore, Authentication, Storage).

However, conceptually, you can think of data operations in terms of:

-   **Firestore Data Structure:**
    -   `users/{userId}/itineraries/{itineraryId}`: Documents storing itinerary data for each user.
    -   `userChats/{userId}/messages/{messageId}`: Collection storing chat messages for each user.
    -   `sharedItineraries/{sharedItineraryId}`: Documents managing shared itinerary metadata and collaborators.
    -   `users/{userId}`: Documents storing user profile information.

-   **Firebase Authentication:**
    -   Handles user sign-in and session management.

-   **Google Maps Platform APIs & Gemini API:**
    -   Used via JavaScript SDKs directly in the frontend for map interactions, location searches, distance calculations, and chatbot functionality.
